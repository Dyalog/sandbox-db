                           APLrobots workspace                                                                
                                                                                                              
   This workspace was created following the Crobots concept.                                                  
                                                                                                              
   APLrobots is a game based on computer programming.                                                         
                                                                                                              
   Unlike arcade type games which require human inputs controlling some object, all                           
strategy in APLrobots must be completed before the actual game begins.  Game strategy is                      
condensed into a program that you design and write.  Your program controls a robot whose                      
mission is to seek out, track, and destroy other robots, each running a different program.                    
Each robot is equally equipped, and up to six robots may compete at once.  APLrobots is                       
best played among several people, each refining their own robot program, then matching                        
program against program.                                                                                      
                                                                                                              
   The workspace simulates a battlefield where robots compete to gain control over it. As                     
the robots fight a Supervisor takes care of the timing and the display.                                       
                                                                                                              
   The Supervisor and each robot run in separate threads.                                                     
                                                                                                              
   The robot programs can use functions to scan for opponents, start and stop drive                           
mechanisms, fire cannons, etc.  After the programs are written into separate namespaces,                      
the battle is started and observed.  Robots moving, missiles flying and exploding, and some                   
status information displayed on the screen, in real-time.
